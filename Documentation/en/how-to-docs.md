# How to Contribute to the Documentation

## Language

The ideal case is for all documentation to be bilignual: [SK](../sk/), [EN](./).
In general, everything needs to have a Slovak documentation. Equally, as the project is public, among other reasons as a presentation of the members, at least all public-facing parts should be documented in English as well (e.g. general information about the project and structure, about the organisation, and about usage, including API calls).

## Documentation format and structure

The Documentation is written in **Markdown** and closely follows the project structure - each peoject component (Backend, Frontend, Node/Hardware) has its own documentation. The aim is for each component to be developed independently.

Docs are split into separate files (pages) that contain thematically distinct units (e.g. this guide is separate from the project [structure](structure.md)).

These files are connected by links: external with full path, internal using **relative** paths, which allows for easier navigation to e.g. the correct language version of a component documentation (aided by symbolic links, see `./Backend`).

## Building docs [TODO!!]
