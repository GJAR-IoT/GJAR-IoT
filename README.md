# GJAR IoT Project

An Internet of Things project at [GJAR](https://www.gjar-po.sk), which consists of a set of IoT Nodes collecting air and noise data from rooms across the school building. Our web interface is at <https://iot.gjar-po.sk>.

The project is made of three inter-dependent parts:
  * The [Nodes](https://github.com/GJAR-IoT/GJAR-IoT-Node) (we also call it Hardware, but the team deals with software too)
	This is the part that runs on our Arduino devices and uses Wi-fi to feed data to...
  * The [Backend](https://github.com/GJAR-IoT/GJAR-IoT-Backend)
	Code, settings and tools for the central backend server that collects the data, stores them and provides an API for...
  * The [Frontend](https://github.com/GJAR-IoT/GJAR-IoT-Frontend)
	Our interactive web interface that allows viewing the data in graphs, and selecting exports to CSV.

Documentation in English and Slovak can be found in the directory Documentation: [EN](/Documentation/en/README.md), [SK](/Documentation/sk/README.md)
